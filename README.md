# Student Performance Data Visualization

## Domain
Education Analytics

## Objective
To analyze student academic performance data and identify factors that influence exam results using data visualization techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about students' study hours, attendance, exam scores, and gender.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- VS Code

## Analysis Performed
- Data overview and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of study habits and academic performance

## Key Insights
- Study hours have a strong positive impact on exam performance.
- Higher attendance is associated with better academic results.

## Future Enhancements
- Build a machine learning model to predict student pass/fail outcomes.
- Deploy insights using a Streamlit dashboard.

## Machine Learning Extension

The project was extended by adding a Machine Learning component using **Linear Regression**.

### Model Details
- **Input features:** study_hours, attendance
- **Target variable:** exam_score
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression

### Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

Prediction results and visual comparisons between actual and predicted exam scores are included in the notebook.
